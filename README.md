In this project I implemented three probability inference algortihms:
<br>
1. Basic inferece using the law of total probability. For more information click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_probability) 
2. Variable elimination where the elimintaion order is according the ABC. For more information about the algorithm click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_elimination)
3. Variable elimination where the elimintaion order is according the an heuristics of my choosing (explanation in docs file).

<b>The efficiency is calculated by number of additions and multiplications which are made during calculation.</b>

<b>Excecution:</b>

Excecution is performed form the cmd:
- Make sure you are in the right library and all requierd files are in it as well.
- Type ```javac *.java```
- Type ```java Ex1```
- The output file will appear in the project.
